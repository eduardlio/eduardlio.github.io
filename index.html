          <h2>Spandx</h2>
          <p>
             Spandx is an interactive surface which allows children to learn about the basics of space physics. It consists of a table frame with a sheet of spandex stretched over it. Under it is a projector and a Microsoft kinect sensor. Raised onto a platform, the spandex sheet has simulations of the solar system projected from underneath. As children step up onto it, they are able to push the spandex as far as they can to see the effects of gravity wells in the solar system: the planets' orbits are disrupted, the sun flies out of control and planets collide. </p>

          <h2>Project and Process</h2><p>DECO3850 Physical Computing and Interaction Design Studio is a course which offers students an opportunity to design, build and exhibit an installation over the course of a university semester. Students work in groups to develop their product through an iterative design process involving copious amounts of feedback with contact, workshop and studio sessions in which the lecturer and tutors offer sage—at times opposing thus confusing—advice. This semester’s theme was: “Designing for playful and open-ended interactions in everyday life” for which four sub-contexts were provided: healthy ageing, learning in early years, street computing and social presence and awareness. </p>
<p>Through a discussion process called The World Cafe, ideas were pulled apart, combined with others and eventually polished into presentable ideas. Groups formed from these ideas and work began. But not for all. Among others, Team Rogue Learning had the target in their sights: a physical interactive installation for children to learn...about what? Brainstorming sessions became as frequent as they were intense. Ideas to teach programming using fiducial markers or an augmented reality grammatical error checker to learn the correct use of a semicolon had spawned from these sessions. One idea, however, survived the test of both originality and relevance (and the tutors). Spandx was born.</p>

<p>Having a cross-functional team has its ups and downs. We each had our strengths: I loved research, documentation and product design, Andy loved design, I had seen Gabby excel in Unity programming before and Mitch seemed to have the gift of the gab. Although it wasn't always sunshine and roses, being a part of such a multi-disciplinary team proved to be inspiring. Documentation mostly involved reiterating research in a way that was useful to our presentations; school syllabus items and curriculum links were integral to our product. While documentation and research dominated most of my time in the studio initially, product design became a large part of my role given my understanding of the target audience. With some previous experience in amateur Sketch Up structures, I was able to draft up my sketches into 3D models. These proved to be essential in communicating the idea to our peers. </p>

<p>By diving into the depths of education, I found myself more and more intrigued by the fundamentals of learning and teaching through the different learning styles. Neil Fleming is currently a teacher in New Zealand and is responsible for the conception of the VARK learning modalities. They stand for Visual, Aural, Read/Write and Kinesthetic learning. This model of education has been employed around the world and in education institutions of all kinds. Combined with Acuff and Reiher's Stages of Cognitive Progression (similar to Piaget's), I was able to apply solid reasoning and research behind the design choices made in building spandx.

          <h2>Background research</h2><h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>This report argues the importance of interaction design in kinesthetic learning and the roles that students play in this context. Through the discussion of the background research found in the development of spandx, the design of the research conducted throughout this process is presented with a focus on Fleming’s (1992) model of Learning modalities and Acuff and Reiher’s (1997) Four Stages of cognitive Progression.</p>
