> Note: A lot of this post is just me complaining about working from home. It's stressful, sure, but I cannot emphasise enough how grateful I am to be working right now. 

For the last few weeks, I've been working from home. Knowing it was going to be a weird to adapt to, I decided on a routine which I thought would work:

1. Get up at 7am
2. Make some coffee (~5mins)
3. Meditate (15mins)
4. Start work at 7:30 
5. Break for lunch at 12pm (30mins)
6. More work
7. Stop working at 4pm

Realistically, it's more like:

1. Get up at 8:30am
2. Straight to work
3. Make coffee after answering emails and checking on the tasks
4. Forget to eat lunch, eat a banana and get back to work
5. Stop at around 5:30pm
6. Feel a bit guilty about leaving that one ticket incomplete
7. Start working on it
8. Look at the clock
9. it's 10pm

Not every day is like that. Some days are easier, when I'm waiting on someone else to do something I can just update documentation or learn about different development frameworks. Other days it's more intense and that residual stress works its way into my weekends and weeknights. I wish I could say I had a concrete solution but I don't otherwise I'd be a cement mixer AhehaehahaHA[^1]. Anyway, here's my take on staying sane working from home.

## TL;DR: Separate work and life

It sounds so stupidly obvious but if you're in a crammed space and you manage your life on two machines like I do, it can get a bit hard to manage.

If you have an office, work in your office and don't go back in there outside of work hours. If you have a work laptop, tuck that shit away until you need it next. But if you're like me and you're working on a laptop, don't check your work email, hell, don't even visit the work directory on your laptop[^2]. Don't open your work chat either. Move Teams, Skype, Slack or whatever away from your home screen. Disable automatically launching it on startup. It just opens up some space in your head for things that aren't related to work. This was the biggest one for me because when I'm working on a project a lot of my headspace gets taken up by every detail that has to go into it. Being a near-solo developer on projects can mean carrying SO much extra baggage containing context, tech debt, what's coming up etc. 

## Brain dumps

With all this headspace taken up your mind can start to go crazy right. For me, anyway, there are always alarm bells ringing and some voice on a PA system blaring "REMAIN CALM" and proceeds to list everything I have to do on repeat and in very big subtitles. It can all get a bit overwhelming. 

![screaming calm](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdata.whicdn.com%2Fimages%2F319821881%2Foriginal.jpg "REMAIN CALM")

My way of handling this is by doing daily, or even hourly, check-ins. Just see how you're going and how you feel. Type it out! On Notion I have a Check-in table with one entry a day. Over the course of the day I'll add a heading with the time (@now) plus a brief mood ("Ugh" or "fuck yeah"). Then I'll go on to write about how I feel, what I'm stuck on or I'll just whine at my laptop. Cap it at 15 minutes or so so you don't get too carried away. Most times, something more than just unloading my mental burden onto a page will happen. Having everything on a page helps me visualise what there is left to do instead of having it floating about in my head with no real substance and therefore hard to get a grasp on. Chuck that shit into a todo list or a kanban board and I'm ready to go. 

## Take a soft 5

Chill out for five minutes. Take a power nap (Salvador Dali and Thomas Edison were said to have had some neat ideas when they were in that weird sleep/awake limbo). Listen to whales. D E C O M P R E S S. Listen to the [Sleep With Me Podcast](https://www.sleepwithmepodcast.com) because sometimes you just have to have someone to ignore in order to work. I listen to white or ambient noise of cafes and rain and trains or whatever (i have noisli on my phone) or [asoftmurmur.com](https://asoftmurmur.com/).

## Different Strokes

These are some of the things that work for me. If they work for you that's fantastic! But if not, I'd love to hear what strategies you've tried. What your experiences have been working from home in these crazy times. hmu @ [liao.edward@gmail.com](mailto:liao.edward@gmail.com?Subject=Quarantine%20work%strategy). I haven't figured out comments on gatsby yet so in the meantime email me ty.

[^1]: TIL the difference between cement and concrete: Cement contains a bunch of chemicals like calcium silicate, silicon n stuff and is used in concrete. Cement is the powder while concrete is the hardened up version of cement after it's been mixed with water and other stuff (sand n gravel). There is a chemical reaction when cement is mixed and hardened (different depending on whether or not it's hydraulic or non-hydraulic cement).

[^2]: This part is really hard for me because I've set up an alias in my .bashrc to go straight to the project directory. Now, when I open my laptop it's instinct to open bash and hit that command. SUCH A HARD HABIT TO KICK
