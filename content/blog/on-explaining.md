In a technical interview some time ago, I was asked how to send 1000 calls to
an api efficiently. No clue. I muttered something along the lines of
"promises" and "batching the requests". I mean it when I say muttered. I really
stumbled on my words and sounded like an overall incompetent dude. We moved
on from the question and over to some coding comprehension tasks; he'd show me
some code and ask me what the code would do. The tasks were pretty simple but
I couldn't for the life of me explain how I had gotten to the conclusion that
I'd reached sounding, again, like an overall incompetent dude. Stuff makes
sense in my head but how on earth do I get those ideas out? In weird,
disjointed sentences I guess. I attribute such behaviour to two reasons: 

1. My reasoning is a join-the-dots exercise but I don't do it in the right 
order and/or; 
2. I just straight up don't understand what I'm saying. 

Situation #1 has been with me forever. I understand a concept but I lack the 
ability to start at a level and progress sequentially to a given point. 
Sometimes it comes out when I write but especially when I speak (I say 
"sometimes" for writing because I get the chance to draft what I write but 
"sometimes" I get lazy and don't bother). As a result of this, people often 
get confused by what I'm saying and, while I'm speaking I recognise it and 
get further flustered and it just turns into an overall mess where I have 
to clarify certain points that I missed while jumping all over the place (see: 
explaining code, rules of a game, or why I do anything). 

Situation #2 is exactly as it says: I simply don't get it. I don't know how
that code runs, I don't know the exact rules of the game (how the hell do you
split a poker pot programmatically??) and I don't know why I didn't do my
laundry this weekend (yes I do, it was raining and the weather didn't clear up
until later that evening). Sometimes I try to bullshit my way through and,
let's be honest, people who sound like they have no idea probably don't. 
Especially me. But somehow my stubborn, Taurus ass will try, and terribly. This
doesn't happen as much anymore; most of the time I'll just admit that I don't
know and defer to an expert or say that I'll look it up and get back to them.
Before this, I hated not knowing. When someone asked a question, I wanted to
know exactly what I was saying. In a rush of words I'd express my infinite
wisdom and people would stand in awe, parents would nod approvingly (there's
a psychological case study for that somewhere) and it would make perfect sense
to everyone. I still have that fantasy [^1]. After some introspection, I have
a feeling that I know what it is: I wish to look competent. Not to _be_
competent but to look it. It was the shortcut to getting places because
I placed a high emphasis on first impressions. In those first moments,
I learned that it was important to get those first moments right: to establish
a good rapport, get some laughs in, agree in general with what they're saying.
I got good at that part. But what they don't tell you is that you have to be
able to back it up. Well, they certainly didn't tell me. Because after that,
I'll tell ya, my mouth is just autocomplete on autopilot [^2]; nothing makes
sense but sometimes it does. 

Anyweezle, this blog has just been an attempt to get my thoughts in order, my
journey to actually _being_ competent and being able to communicate that. Any
tips? Any comments? Maybe you've experienced this before too, or been in the
presenece of someone who is like this. DM me anytime, would love to chat.

[^1]: My cousin convinced me that his peers could take any topic and dance
  around it as if they were well-versed on the subject despite just hearing 
  about it. I believe that this is where such a fantasy began.

[^2]: Try It! On your phone, type these first words in and then keep tapping the
  first word in your autocomplete and see what happens: 
  - I'm sorry but...
  - Thank you for...
  - What if I...
