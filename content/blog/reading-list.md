There are so many books out there that I haven't had the chance to read yet and
it disappoints me to no end that I probably don't have the attention span to
start and successfully finish them. I've been reading through [Tim
Urban](https://waitbutwhy.com)'s series about [why Elon Musk is one fully sick
dude](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/05/elon-musk-the-worlds-raddest-man.html).
It's a 4-part inquiry on why Musk is doing what he's doing and how he's capable
of doing so (aka the secret sauce). It's really well structured, guiding the
reader from fundamental sciences to its applications, to their consequences and
whatever crazy solution that Musk is working on. The thing that strikes me 
whenever I hear smart people talk is how little I know. I would like to know
more. Partially because I like to know that I know more and partially because
I'm curious.

With non-fiction books I'm trying to find a method in which I can actively
learn what I've read. Nothing so far but if you find something, let me know.
