I've been reading through <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com\">Tim\nUrban</a>'s series about <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/05/elon-musk-the-worlds-raddest-man.html\">why Elon Musk is one fully sick\ndude</a>.\nIt's a 4-part inquiry on why Musk is doing what he's doing and how he's capable\nof doing so (aka the secret sauce). It's really well structured, guiding the\nreader from fundamental sciences to its applications, to their consequences and\nwhatever crazy solution that Musk is working on. The thing that strikes me\nwhenever I hear smart people talk is how little I know. I would like to know\nmore. Partially because I like to know that I know more and partially because\nI'm curious.</p>\n<h2>Book List</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\"Mindset\" by Carol S. Dweck</li>\n<li>\"Power to Compete\" by H.
