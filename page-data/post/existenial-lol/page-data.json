I'm grateful, no doubt, that\nI don't have to write a package which will create web components for me to\nreuse, grateful that someone else that has written a testing framework which\nprettifies my results and even chucks them into a styled html doc. Hell,\nI can barely imagine writing my own load balancer. I don't even know how that\nshit works. I think they used to develop those from scratch.</p>\n<p>The point I'm making is that coding is so last decade. Most stuff is already\ncoded for you. All you have to do is slap them together and the most code that\nyou have to look at is the URLs that you're using. Think ecommerce: shopify for\nyour store, 99 designs for your logos. Canva for ads. facebook marketing. Mail\nchimp for subscriptions n shit. Google analytics to see how things are going.\nAll you have to do is copy paste stuff from A into the settings for B. The role\nof the developer, then, is more of a mindset or mental headspace. Knowing how\nthese things fit together is the role of like a software architect, right? I'm\nworking this out as we go. This is a panic brain-dump.</p>\n<p>In other words, everything becomes low-level and gets replaced with an\nabstracted version of it. Coding websites in straight up html and css is\nlow-level, react and other front-end frameworks are the abstracted version of\nthat. No one I know codes in assembly, it's all python and javascript and .net.\nEverything low-level gets used to build the next big thing. So one day, maybe,\nfront-end frameworks will power whatever's next -- OH WAIT THEY ALREADY DO.\nDrag and drop interface builders (think Wix, Squarespace, etc <sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>) probably\nuse reusable visual components to build their applications. THAT'S MY FIELD. Am\nI being made redundant?? Is my skill becoming useless as we speak?? As a part\nof the no code movement, ANYONE can do what I do. You don't need a degree to\nbuild nice-looking websites anymore. You don't need to know the difference\nbetween <code>var</code>, <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> to build a mail server. What is there left for\nme to do? Maybe one day there will be such a thing as artisinal code.</p>\n<p>As always, I'm blowing things way out of proportion. Sure, code can write code\nbut for now that software is pretty expensive or in early stages. The best that\nI can do is up-skill in my own abilities to code and to understand the stuff\naround code. Coding interviews will still ask me about Big O notation and how\nto write an algorithm to rotate a black and red tree or whatever. How important\nthese things are, I don't know. What I do want to learn are the things below\nthe low-level stuff. I've been making my way back into math and more\nfundamental things. It's always cool knowing how that stuff works. Most\nrecently, I watched the numberphile video on the Josephus problem. Go watch it.\nThe other side of that spectrum is the more important stuff that people are\nraving on about: machine learning, VR/AR. In that Gary Hustwit documentary\n\"Objectified\" <sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>, the guy who invented the ergonomic peeler says something\nalong the lines of \"design for the extremes and the middle will sort itself\nout\". I'll figure out the stuff in the middle once I get the other ends.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>Not you, dreamweaver, although it might spit out some react or vue code\nidk.
