No clue. I muttered something along the lines of\n\"promises\" and \"batching the requests\". I mean it when I say muttered. I really\nstumbled on my words and sounded like an overall incompetent dude. We moved\non from the question and over to some coding comprehension tasks; he'd show me\nsome code and ask me what the code would do. The tasks were pretty simple but\nI couldn't for the life of me explain how I had gotten to the conclusion that\nI'd reached sounding, again, like an overall incompetent dude. Stuff makes\nsense in my head but how on earth do I get those ideas out? In weird,\ndisjointed sentences I guess. I attribute such behaviour to two reasons: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>My reasoning is a join-the-dots exercise but I don't do it in the right\norder and/or; </li>\n<li>I just straight up don't understand what I'm saying. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Situation #1 has been with me forever. I understand a concept but I lack the\nability to start at a level and progress sequentially to a given point.\nSometimes it comes out when I write but especially when I speak (I say\n\"sometimes\" for writing because I get the chance to draft what I write but\n\"sometimes\" I get lazy and don't bother). As a result of this, people often\nget confused by what I'm saying and, while I'm speaking I recognise it and\nget further flustered and it just turns into an overall mess where I have\nto clarify certain points that I missed while jumping all over the place (see:\nexplaining code, rules of a game, or why I do anything). </p>\n<p>Situation #2 is exactly as it says: I simply don't get it. I don't know how\nthat code runs, I don't know the exact rules of the game (how the hell do you\nsplit a poker pot programmatically??) and I don't know why I didn't do my\nlaundry this weekend (yes I do, it was raining and the weather didn't clear up\nuntil later that evening). Sometimes I try to bullshit my way through and,\nlet's be honest, people who sound like they have no idea probably don't.\nEspecially me. But somehow my stubborn, Taurus ass will try, and terribly. This\ndoesn't happen as much anymore; most of the time I'll just admit that I don't\nknow and defer to an expert or say that I'll look it up and get back to them.\nBefore this, I hated not knowing. When someone asked a question, I wanted to\nknow exactly what I was saying. In a rush of words I'd express my infinite\nwisdom and people would stand in awe, parents would nod approvingly (there's\na psychological case study for that somewhere) and it would make perfect sense\nto everyone. I still have that fantasy <sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>. After some introspection, I have\na feeling that I know what it is: I wish to look competent. Not to <em>be</em>\ncompetent but to look it. It was the shortcut to getting places because\nI placed a high emphasis on first impressions. In those first moments,\nI learned that it was important to get those first moments right: to establish\na good rapport, get some laughs in, agree in general with what they're saying.\nI got good at that part. But what they don't tell you is that you have to be\nable to back it up. Well, they certainly didn't tell me. Because after that,\nI'll tell ya, my mouth is just autocomplete on autopilot <sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>; nothing makes\nsense but sometimes it does. </p>\n<p>Anyweezle, this blog has just been an attempt to get my thoughts in order, my\njourney to actually <em>being</em> competent and being able to communicate that. Any\ntips? Any comments? Maybe you've experienced this before too, or been in the\npresenece of someone who is like this. DM me anytime, would love to chat.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>My cousin convinced me that his peers could take any topic and dance\naround it as if they were well-versed on the subject despite just hearing\nabout it.
