Spandx is an interactive surface which allows children to learn about the basics of space physics. It consists of a table frame with a sheet of spandex stretched over it. Under it is a projector and a Microsoft kinect sensor. Raised onto a platform, the spandex sheet has simulations of the solar system projected from underneath. As children step up onto it, they are able to push the spandex as far as they can to see the effects of gravity wells in the solar system: the planets' orbits are disrupted, the sun flies out of control and planets collide.
