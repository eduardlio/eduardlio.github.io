<p>DECO3850 Physical Computing and Interaction Design Studio is a course which offers students an opportunity to design, build and exhibit an installation over the course of a university semester. Students work in groups to develop their product through an iterative design process involving copious amounts of feedback with contact, workshop and studio sessions in which the lecturer and tutors offer sage—at times opposing thus confusing—advice. This semester’s theme was: “Designing for playful and open-ended interactions in everyday life” for which four sub-contexts were provided: healthy ageing, learning in early years, street computing and social presence and awareness. </p>
<p>Through a discussion process called The World Cafe, ideas were pulled apart, combined with others and eventually polished into presentable ideas. Groups formed from these ideas and work began. But not for all. Among others, Team Rogue Learning had the target in their sights: a physical interactive installation for children to learn...about what? Brainstorming sessions became as frequent as they were intense. Ideas to teach programming using fiducial markers or an augmented reality grammatical error checker to learn the correct use of a semicolon had spawned from these sessions. One idea, however, survived the test of both originality and relevance (and the tutors). Spandx was born.</p>
