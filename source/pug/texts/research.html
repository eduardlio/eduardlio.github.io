<p>Through discussion with teachers and other industry experts, it was clear that there was an aspect of education that the current system had forgotten. We saw the traditional methods of teaching through pen and paper and sought to improve it through the integration of movement and tech-based learning. The introduction of iPads and tablets into the current school environment only enforces the sedentary and antisocial lifestyle which later becomes hard to get rid of.

It was through <a class="hvr-underline-from-left-body" href="https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/en/">Kerbal Space Program</a> that we initially decided to follow the space theme but it was through Elon Musk that we were truly motivated to pursue the idea of space exploration.

We decided to implement the two together—space and education—into a physical space for children—specifically, 3rd graders—to learn the basics of space and time. Getting children to stand up to interact with something other than a keyboard, iPad or pencil was our main goal and Spandx was the result.

Kinesthetic learning is an instinct to children. In fact, kindergarten learning has a primarily kinesthetic approach. Jean Piaget, Swiss pioneer in child psychology, has conceptualised four stages of cognitive development eponymously named Piaget’s Stages of Cognitive Development. Since children start to learn the concepts of space between the ages 8 and 11, they fall in the category of “Concrete Operations”. This is the the stage of cognitive development where operations such as ordering, logic, numbers, geometry and even physics are established at an elementary level (Piaget J., 1997).
