<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>This report argues the importance of interaction design in kinesthetic learning and the roles that students play in this context. Through the discussion of the background research found in the development of spandx, the design of the research conducted throughout this process is presented with a focus on Fleming’s (1992) model of Learning modalities and Acuff and Reiher’s (1997) Four Stages of cognitive Progression.</p>
